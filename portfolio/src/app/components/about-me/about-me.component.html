<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Jeroen, a linguist-turned-developer.</p>
<p>This so-called single-page application (SPA) is an exercise in web development in the Angular framework.</p>
<p>It is also where I put stuff from a bunch of my projects, mainly in programming or linguistics.</p>
<p>It is not nearly done, so come back in a while.</p>
<p>Much love,<br>JW</p>
